**This branch contains the application MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with user-friendly design, cleaner, optimized, and stable API endpoints, including versions 0.8.0-beta (frontend refactor & design) and 1.0.0-beta (backend refactor & optimizing).**

# SweetCinema
SweetCinema is an open-source educational project inspired by an idea from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/movie-reservation-system) and utilizes [HappyCinema](https://www.happycinema.ro/) as a business model reference for replicating core functionalities and user flow patterns. The primary motivation was to develop a business solution that closely mirrors the selected reference model while maintaining originality in implementation.

## Demo

### Visual presentation
Images for presentation of the application are present in the [demo directory](.demo).

### Local installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the project folder:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vladutcretu/SweetCinema.git
   cd SweetCinema
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the SweetCinema root with the following content:
    ```sh
    DB_NAME=your_db_name         # Name of the Postgres database
    DB_USER=your_username        # Postgres username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password    # Postgres password
    DB_HOST=db                   # Don't edit to match the Postgres service name from docker-compose
    DB_PORT=5432                 # Don't edit to match default Postgres port

    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id # Read https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_app_client_secret # Copy from the same place as client_id

    VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
    VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id # Same value as the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID variable
    ```

3. Build and run the containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

4. Prepare database:
    ```sh
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py makemigrations
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py loaddata populateDB.json
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to:
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) for admin panel
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/swagger/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/schema/swagger/) for OpenAPI documentation
