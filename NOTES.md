## Development Notes

### üîú Sprint #10 (started on 9 June 2025; ended on <i>TBA</i>): "Backend & Frontend: Refactor & design"
- **About current status and next steps:** 
    - After completing the MVP (Minimum Viable Product), the next step is to systematically enhance each of the existing pages (7). This includes implementing a more user-friendly interface using Chakra UI library, completing the existing models with relevant fields, and improving overall code quality by refactoring the codebase, evaluating API endpoints, optimizing database queries, and increasing test coverage.

- **About future development methodology:** 
    - During this phase, which aligns with the beta version of the app, a new branch called `beta` will be created. The Pull Request (PR) workflow will be used to simulate working on an existing codebase that requires rework. This means starting a separate branch for each existing page and avoiding interaction with the `main` branch until the end of the sprint.
    - Since this is not a feature development phase, the work will be more iterative and less task-oriented. All specific changes and improvements will be documented in the Release Notes for version v0.8.0-beta.

- Update `AuthContext` & `GET /api/users/user/` to save the `city` in `user` object
- Update `StaffDashboard page` to include for `Cashier` group the next components:
    - a `Booking dashboard` that will show all `Bookings` with `status=reserved` from that `City` (data from updated `GET /api/tickets/bookings/?city={userCityId}`), with option to complete bookings (create `POST /api/tickets/reserve/complete/` to update `status=purchased`)
    - a `Showtime dashboard` that will show all `Showtimes` from that `City` (data from `GET /api/showtimes/?city={userCityId}`), their seats and status (data from `/api/showtimes/{id}/seats/`), with option to make a payment for these seats like a regular user does in `ShowtimeDetail page`
- Update `StaffDashboard page` to include for `Manager` group a `ShowtimeReport` (create `GET /api/showtime/{id}/reports/` endpoint) with analytics data (calculate tickets sold count, total revenue, and room occupancy percentage)
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #8 (started on 2 July 2025; ended on 3 July 2025): "Backend & Frontend: Multiple bookings & more management of their status" 
- Create `ShowtimeList page` to use `GET /api/showtimes/upcoming/?city={selectedCityId}` to group showtimes by date in chronological order
- Implement multiple seat booking functionality:
    - modify `POST /api/tickets/reserve/` & `POST /api/tickets/pay/` to accept seat_ids array: [1, 2, 3] (with maximum length for `reserve`) in order to create multiple `Booking` instances (1 per seat) for a single transaction
    - update `ShowtimeDetail page` to allow multiple seat selection using checkboxes
- Implement automatic reservation expiration functionality:
    - add `expired` status to `Booking.STATUS_CHOICES` and `expires_at` field to `Booking` model (autocompleted for `status=reserved` instances with `Showtime.time - 30 minutes` value)
    - create schedule cleanup via cron job to set `status=expired` to instances with `Booking.expired_at` past the current time
    - hide/disable reserve, pay buttons if less than 30 minutes to showtime start
- Implement payment timeout functionality:
    - update `PaymentCreate page` to include a 1 minute countdown timer to complete the payment; if not submited, fetch `POST /api/tickets/pay/timeout/` to update `Payment.status` to `declined` (`Payment.booking.status` will automatically become `failed_payment`) and inform user
    - autocomplete `expires_at` field of `Booking model` for `status=pending_payment` with value `timedate.now + 1 minute` and include in scheduled cleanup cron job
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #7 (started on 1 July 2025; ended on 1 July 2025): "Backend & Frontend: User profile & personal bookings"
- Create `UserProfile page` to use account info (username, group) from `AuthContext` and then the following endpoints:
	- `GET /api/users/user/{id}/bookings/` to display user's bookings history
	- `POST /api/tickets/booking/{id}/cancel/` to allow user to cancel reservation (Booking.status=canceled)
- On the same page group users staff, `Manager` & `Employee` will see a link to `StaffDashboard page`, but the access to it is password protected and groups will have the following access flow:
    - first time: since accounts are created using Google email, when groups will access link they need to set an account password using `POST /api/users/set-password/`
    - next times: they introduce the password on every session and it's get checked by `POST /api/users/verify-password/`
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #6 (started on 26 June 2025; ended on 29 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - Staff dashboard & actions"
- Create groups `Manager` (can CRUD `City`, `Theater`, `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime` and Read `Booking`, `Payment`), `Employee` (can CRUD `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime`) and the following API endpoints with staff permissions: `POST api/users/promote/manager/{user_id}/`, `POST api/users/promote/employee/{user_id}/` and `POST api/users/demote/{user_id}/`

---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #5 (started on 23 June 2025; ended on 25 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - Tickets reservations & payments"
- Start `tickets` app and create `Booking` and `Payment` models
- Use the foreign key relationships between models `Booking`, `Showtime`, `Seat` (via `Theater`) to check the status of a `Seat` object for a `Showtime` in `Booking` table entries as is following: 
	- no instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` means the `Seat` object is unoccupied
	- instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` with status=reserved/purchased means the `Seat` object is reserved/purchased
- Create, respecting the above logic, the API endpoint `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/seats/` with following sample response:
    ```json
        [
            {"id": 1, "row": 1, "column": 1, "status": "available"},
            {"id": 2, "row": 1, "column": 2, "status": "reserved"}, 
            {"id": 3, "row": 1, "column": 3, "status": "purchased"},
        ]
    ```
- Fetch the above mentioned endpoint in `ShowtimeDetail page` to present the status of every seat of the theater for the specific showtime
- Set, on the previously mentioned page, for every of the newly implemented seat representation two options: reserve a seat and pay a seat 
	- Reserve a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/reserve/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=reserved and return a confirmation message afterwards
	- Pay a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/pay/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=pending_payment and redirect user to `PaymentCreate page`, where user will introduce data to `POST /api/tickets/payment/{bookingId}/`; if data is correct (condition to fail is `Payment.amount` != `Payment.booking.showtime.price`) and `Payment` status is accepted then update `Booking` status to `purchased`, else if is not, `Payment` status gonna be declined and `Booking` status will be `payment declined` (seat becomes available to be booked)
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #4 (started on 22 June 2025; ended on 23 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - User authentication with Google"
- Implement signing up & logging in with Google account using OAuth2.0 and JWT, respecting the following workflow:
	- Create `users` app and `POST /api/auth/google/` endpoint to receive the `id_token` from the frontend after the user logs in with their Google account
    - Validate the `id_token` on the backend and create or retrieve the user account
    - Generate a JWT and return to the frontend to store it in `AuthContext`
    - Create `POST /api/token/verify/` to validate the token when required and `POST /api/token/refresh/` to renew access token when expires

- Build core design elements like `header`, `navbar`, `footer` to draw page layout
- Build to ensure the following user workflow: choose `City` > choose `Movie` (see `Genre`) > choose `Showtime` (see `Theater` & `Seat`):
    - `Main page`: fetch data from `GET /api/movies/` in movie grid and add link to `MovieDetails page` in every movie card
    - `MovieDetails page`: fetch data from `GET /api/movies/{id}/` to retrieve a single movie, fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/` to list his showtimes and add link to `ShowtimeDetail page`
    - `ShowtimeDetail page`: fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/` to retrieve a single showtime, fetch data from `GET /api/locations/theaters/{id}/` & `GET /api/locations/seats/` to retrieve his theater & seats add links to `reserve a ticket` and `buy a ticket`
