## Development Notes

### üîú Sprint #6 (started on 26 June 2025; ended on <i>TBA</i>): "Backend & Frontend - Staff dashboard & actions"
- Create groups `Manager` (can CRUD `City`, `Theater`, `Seat`, `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime` and Read `Booking`, `Payment`) & `Employee` (can CRUD `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime`) and the following API endpoints with superuser permissions: `POST api/users/promote/manager/{user_id}/`, `POST api/users/promote/employee/{user_id}/` and `POST api/users/demote/{user_id}/`
- Create, respecting the permissions of each group, API endpoints for completing the same actions each group can do from the backend admin panel
- Build a frontend staff dashboard page to let staff members (superuser, manager & employee) interact with above mentioned endpoints

### ‚úÖ Sprint #5 (started on 23 June 2025; ended on 25 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - Tickets reservations & payments"
- Start `tickets` app and create `Booking` and `Payment` models
- Use the foreign key relationships between models `Booking`, `Showtime`, `Seat` (via `Theater`) to check the status of a `Seat` object for a `Showtime` in `Booking` table entries as is following: 
	- no instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` means the `Seat` object is unoccupied
	- instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` with status=reserved/purchased means the `Seat` object is reserved/purchased
- Create, respecting the above logic, the API endpoint `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/seats/` with following sample response:
```json
	[
        {"id": 1, "row": 1, "column": 1, "status": "available"},
        {"id": 2, "row": 1, "column": 2, "status": "reserved"}, 
        {"id": 3, "row": 1, "column": 3, "status": "purchased"},
    ]
```
- Fetch the above mentioned endpoint in `showtime detail page` to present the status of every seat of the theater for the specific showtime
- Set, on the previously mentioned page, for every one of the newly implemented seat representation two options: reserve a seat and pay a seat 
	- Reserve a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/reserve/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=reserved and return a confirmation message afterwards
	- Pay a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/pay/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=pending_payment and redirect user to `payment create page`, where user will introduce data to `POST /api/tickets/payment/{bookingId}/`; if data is correct and `Payment` status is accepted then update `Booking` status to purchased, else if is not, `Payment` status gonna be declined and `Booking` status will be payment declined (available to book)

### ‚úÖ Sprint #4 (started on 22 June 2025; ended on 23 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - User authentication with Google"
- Implement signing up & logging in with Google account using OAuth2.0 and JWT, respecting the following workflow:
	- Create `users` app and `POST /api/auth/google/` endpoint to receive the `id_token` from the frontend after the user logs in with their Google account
    - Validate the `id_token` on the backend and create or retrieve the user account
    - Generate a JWT and return to the frontend to store it in `localStorage`
    - Create `POST /api/token/verify/` to validate the token when required and `POST /api/token/refresh/` to renew access token when expires
	- Display `reserve ticket` & `buy ticket` options from `ShowtimeDetail` page to logged in users only
	- Build `logout` button to remove the token from `localStorage`

### ‚úÖ Sprint #3 (started on 14 June 2025; ended on 18 June 2025): "Frontend - Movies, Locations, Showtimes"
- Build core design elements: `header`, `navbar`, `footer`
- Develop the following pages: 
    - `main page`: draw movie cards (fetch data from `GET /api/movies/`) and add link to `movie details page`
    - `movie details page`: show detailed informations about a single movie (fetch data from `GET /api/movies/{id}/`), about showtimes informations (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/`) and add link to `showtime details page` (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/`)
    - `showtime details page`: show detailed informations about a single showtime (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/`), about theater and seats (fetch data from `GET /api/locations/theaters/{id}/` and `GET /api/locations/seats/`) and add links to `reserve a ticket` and `buy a ticket`.
- Do backend updates to ensure good working user workflow: choose `City` > choose `Movie` (see `Genre`) > choose `Showtime` (see `Theater` & `Seat`)

### ‚úÖ Sprint #2 (started on 13 June 2025; ended on 13 June 2025): "Backend - Movies, Locations, Showtimes"

    - `GET /api/seats/?theater=<ID>`: list all the `Seat` objects linked to a specific `Theater` object
- Start `showtimes` app and create `Showtime` model, alongside with the following API endpoints:
    - `GET /api/showtimes/?city=<ID>&movie=<ID>`: list all the `Showtime` objects linked to a specific `City` and `Movie` objects
    - `GET /api/showtimes/<ID>/`: detail a specific `Showtime` object with linked `Theater` object included
