    - User can choose a showtime to see details about, including the available seats in the theater where it's playing.

- ‚öôÔ∏è <b>Backend:</b>
    - Build `Genre`, `Movie`, `City`, `Theater`, `Seat` and `Showtime` models
    - Create following API endpoints: `GET /api/movies/`, `GET /api/movies/{id}/`, `GET /api/movies/genres/`, `GET /api/locations/cities/`, `GET /api/locations/seats/`, `GET /api/locations/theaters/`, `GET /api/locations/theaters/{id}/`, `GET /api/showtimes/`, `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/`
    - Add filters to some endpoints to get the necessary information; can read below about every endpoint used, their filters and the data received.
- üñºÔ∏è <b>Frontend:</b>
    - Set page layout and core functionalities
    - Fetch data for all `City` objects using `/api/locations/cities/` endpoint to let user select their City location using `header navigation bar` component; selection is being saved to `localStorage` via a context, in order to being used on another API endpoints calls
    - Fetch data for all `Movie` objects using `/api/movies/` endpoint to present in the `main page`, using `MovieList` page components, a list of the existing movies to the user
    - Add in the `main page` the option for a user to see additional details about a movie, clicking a button would reach `movie detail page`
    - Fetch data for a single `Movie` object using `/api/movies/{id}/` endpoint to present in the `movie detail page`, using `MovieDetail` page components, more details about the movie requested by user
    - Fetch data for specific `Showtime` objects using `/api/showtimes/?movie={id}&theater__city={id}` to present in the `movie detail page`, using `MovieDetail` page components, a list of the existing showtimes to the user, based by user movie and city choice
    - Add in the `movie detail page` the option for a user to see additional details about a showtime, clicking a button would reach `showtime detail page`
    - Fetch data for a single `Showtime` object using `/api/showtimes/{id}/` to present in the `showtime detail page`, using `ShowtimeDetail` page components, more details about the showtime requested by user
    - Fetch data for all specific `Seat` objects using `/api/locations/seats/?theater={id}` to present in the `showtime detail page`, using `ShowtimeDetail` page components, a list of the existing seats in the theater where the showtime will take place


## Development Notes

### üîú Sprint #4 (started on 22 June 2025; ended on <i>TBA</i>)
- Implement signing up & logging in with Google account using OAuth2.0 and JWT, respecting the following workflow:
	- Create `users` app and `POST /api/auth/google/` endpoint to receive the `id_token` from the frontend after the user logs in with their Google account
    - Validate the `id_token` on the backend and create or retrieve the user account
    - Generate a JWT and return to the frontend to store it in `localStorage`
    - Create `POST /api/token/verify/` to validate the token when needed
	- Display `reserve ticket` & `buy ticket` options from `ShowtimeDetail` page to logged in users only
	- Build`logout` button to remove the token from `localStorage`

### ‚úÖ Sprint #3 (started on 14 June 2025; ended on 18 June 2025)
- Build core design elements: `header`, `navbar`, `footer`
- Develop the following pages: 
    - `main page`: draw movie cards (fetch data from `GET /api/movies/`) and add link to `movie details page`
    - `movie details page`: show detailed informations about a single movie (fetch data from `GET /api/movies/{id}/`), about showtimes informations (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/`) and add link to `showtime details page` (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/`)
    - `showtime details page`: show detailed informations about a single showtime (fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/`), about theater and seats (fetch data from `GET /api/locations/theaters/{id}/` and `GET /api/locations/seats/`) and add links to `reserve a ticket` and `buy a ticket`.
- Do backend updates to ensure good working user workflow: choose `City` > choose `Movie` (see `Genre`) > choose `Showtime` (see `Theater` & `Seat`)

### ‚úÖ Sprint #2 (started on 13 June 2025; ended on 13 June 2025)
