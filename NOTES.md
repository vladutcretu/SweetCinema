## Development Notes

### ‚úÖ Sprint #12 (started on 8 August 2025; ended on 12 August 2025): "Backend & Frontend: User model, Endpoints filtering & pagination"
- Create `User` model (extends `AbstractUser`) to merge `UserProfile` model and permissions logic from `Groups` (Manager, Employee, Cashier) to `role` field (Manager, Planner, Cashier) for optimizing database queries; also add `birthday` and boolean `promotions`, `newsletter` fields
- Update `UserManagement component` and API endpoint to let staff set user's role and city
- Update `Profile page` and API endpoint to let user set it's own city (except if user is Cashier), birthday (can not be updated) and promotions status (on/off)
- Create `Newsletter page` and API endpoint to let user choose if wants to receive newsletter
- Implement ordering filters and pagination for endpoints that returns a list presented in a table and update frontend accordingly
- Replace frontend setError text with backend validationError alert to provide more context when something bad happens
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #11 (started on 18 July 2025; ended on 29 July 2025): "Backend: Refactor & design"
- After completing the frontend refactor and design phase, the next step is to fill business logic gaps by enhancing the existing models with relevant fields, evaluating endpoints design (refactoring / updating serializers, view logic & URL naming), optimizing database queries, and increasing test coverage
- The methodology cheatsheet for this stage includes:
    1. Get every family of endpoints (e.g. movie endpoints) and identify all the components involved: url -> views -> serializers -> models.
    2. Evaluate all components, include using Django-silk & Django Debug Toolbar, and perform the required updates & optimizations (e.g. avoiding over-fetching responses, using select_related & prefetch_related queries, adding new validators)
    3. Write tests with Pytest Django to obtain a good coverage by pytest-cov
- During this phase there won't be interactions with the `main` branch and the Pull Request (PR) workflow will be used to merge every refactored feature to `beta`
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #10 (started on 9 July 2025; ended on 15 July 2025): "Frontend: Refactor & design"
- After completing the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) with a wireframe frontend design and mixed logic inside components, the next step is to systematically enhance each of the 7 existing pages. This includes implementing Chakra UI library for designing components, Axios for fetching data, and improving overall frontend code quality by refactoring the codebase, creating reusable components, individual services & hooks
- Since this is not a feature development phase and the work will be more iterative and less task-oriented, the methodology cheatsheet include:
    1. Get every page (e.g. movies page) and identify all the components involved: design, hooks & fetches.
    2. Evaluate all components and perform the required updates & optimizations to divide them into separate, cleaner, and reusable ones, while adding a user-friendly interface
    3. Perform manual testing for all the reworked pages
- The Pull Request (PR) workflow will be used to simulate working on an existing codebase that requires rework. This means starting a separate branch for each existing page and merging to `beta` when the rework is done, avoiding interaction with the `main` branch until the end of the Sprint
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #9 (started on 6 July 2025; ended on 6 July 2025): "Backend & Frontend: Cashier group & showtime reporting"
- Create `UserProfile` model (extends`User` model) with field `city` (ForeignKey) to it
- Create group `Cashier`, update `PATCH /api/users/user/update/{id}/` and the workflow around it to make possible to can set the group & a `city` for user
- Update `AuthContext` & `GET /api/users/user/` to save the `city` in `user` object
- Update `StaffDashboard page` to include for `Cashier` group the next components:
    - a `Booking dashboard` that will show all `Bookings` with `status=reserved` from that `City` (data from updated `GET /api/tickets/bookings/?city={userCityId}`), with option to complete bookings (create `POST /api/tickets/reserve/complete/` to update `status=purchased`)
    - a `Showtime dashboard` that will show all `Showtimes` from that `City` (data from `GET /api/showtimes/?city={userCityId}`), their seats and status (data from `/api/showtimes/{id}/seats/`), with option to make a payment for these seats like a regular user does in `ShowtimeDetail page`
- Update `StaffDashboard page` to include for `Manager` group a `ShowtimeReport` (create `GET /api/showtime/{id}/reports/` endpoint) with analytics data (calculate tickets sold count, total revenue, and room occupancy percentage)
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #8 (started on 2 July 2025; ended on 3 July 2025): "Backend & Frontend: Multiple bookings & more management of their status" 
- Create `ShowtimeList page` to use `GET /api/showtimes/upcoming/?city={selectedCityId}` to group showtimes by date in chronological order
- Implement multiple seat booking functionality:
    - modify `POST /api/tickets/reserve/` & `POST /api/tickets/pay/` to accept seat_ids array: [1, 2, 3] (with maximum length for `reserve`) in order to create multiple `Booking` instances (1 per seat) for a single transaction
    - update `ShowtimeDetail page` to allow multiple seat selection using checkboxes
- Implement automatic reservation expiration functionality:
    - add `expired` status to `Booking.STATUS_CHOICES` and `expires_at` field to `Booking` model (autocompleted for `status=reserved` instances with `Showtime.time - 30 minutes` value)
    - create schedule cleanup via cron job to set `status=expired` to instances with `Booking.expired_at` past the current time
    - hide/disable reserve, pay buttons if less than 30 minutes to showtime start
- Implement payment timeout functionality:
    - update `PaymentCreate page` to include a 1 minute countdown timer to complete the payment; if not submited, fetch `POST /api/tickets/pay/timeout/` to update `Payment.status` to `declined` (`Payment.booking.status` will automatically become `failed_payment`) and inform user
    - autocomplete `expires_at` field of `Booking model` for `status=pending_payment` with value `timedate.now + 1 minute` and include in scheduled cleanup cron job
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #7 (started on 1 July 2025; ended on 1 July 2025): "Backend & Frontend: User profile & personal bookings"
- Create `UserProfile page` to use account info (username, group) from `AuthContext` and then the following endpoints:
    - `GET /api/users/user/{id}/bookings/` to display user's bookings history
    - `POST /api/tickets/booking/{id}/cancel/` to allow user to cancel reservation (Booking.status=canceled)
- On the same page group users staff, `Manager` & `Employee` will see a link to `StaffDashboard page`, but the access to it is password protected and groups will have the following access flow:
    - first time: since accounts are created using Google email, when groups will access link they need to set an account password using `POST /api/users/set-password/`
    - next times: they introduce the password on every session and it's get checked by `POST /api/users/verify-password/`
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #6 (started on 26 June 2025; ended on 29 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - Staff dashboard & actions"
- Create groups `Manager` (can CRUD `City`, `Theater`, `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime` and Read `Booking`, `Payment`), `Employee` (can CRUD `Genre`, `Movie`, `Showtime`) and the following API endpoints with staff permissions: `POST api/users/promote/manager/{user_id}/`, `POST api/users/promote/employee/{user_id}/` and `POST api/users/demote/{user_id}/`
- Create, respecting the permissions of each group, API endpoints for completing the same actions each group can do
- Build `StaffDashboard page` to let staff members (staff, manager & employee) interact with above mentioned endpoints
---
### ‚úÖ Sprint #5 (started on 23 June 2025; ended on 25 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - Tickets reservations & payments"
- Start `tickets` app and create `Booking` and `Payment` models
- Use the foreign key relationships between models `Booking`, `Showtime`, `Seat` (via `Theater`) to check the status of a `Seat` object for a `Showtime` in `Booking` table entries as is following: 
    - no instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` means the `Seat` object is unoccupied
    - instance of `Booking` for `Showtime` + `Seat` with status=reserved/purchased means the `Seat` object is reserved/purchased
- Create, respecting the above logic, the API endpoint `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/seats/` with following sample response:
    ```json
        [
            {"id": 1, "row": 1, "column": 1, "status": "available"},
            {"id": 2, "row": 1, "column": 2, "status": "reserved"}, 
            {"id": 3, "row": 1, "column": 3, "status": "purchased"},
        ]
    ```
- Fetch the above mentioned endpoint in `ShowtimeDetail page` to present the status of every seat of the theater for the specific showtime
- Set, on the previously mentioned page, for every of the newly implemented seat representation two options: reserve a seat and pay a seat 
    - Reserve a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/reserve/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=reserved and return a confirmation message afterwards
    - Pay a seat: fetch `POST /api/tickets/pay/` (sending informations about `Showtime` and `Seat` objects) that will create a `Booking` instance with status=pending_payment and redirect user to `PaymentCreate page`, where user will introduce data to `POST /api/tickets/payment/{bookingId}/`; if data is correct (condition to fail is `Payment.amount` != `Payment.booking.showtime.price`) and `Payment` status is accepted then update `Booking` status to `purchased`, else if is not, `Payment` status gonna be declined and `Booking` status will be `payment declined` (seat becomes available to be booked)

### ‚úÖ Sprint #4 (started on 22 June 2025; ended on 23 June 2025): "Backend & Frontend - User authentication with Google"
- Implement signing up & logging in with Google account using OAuth2.0 and JWT, respecting the following workflow:
    - Create `users` app and `POST /api/auth/google/` endpoint to receive the `id_token` from the frontend after the user logs in with their Google account
    - Validate the `id_token` on the backend and create or retrieve the user account
    - Generate a JWT and return to the frontend to store it in `AuthContext`
    - Create `POST /api/token/verify/` to validate the token when required and `POST /api/token/refresh/` to renew access token when expires
    - Display `reserve ticket` & `buy ticket` options from `ShowtimeDetail page` to logged in users only
    - Build `logout` button to remove the token from `localStorage`

### ‚úÖ Sprint #3 (started on 14 June 2025; ended on 18 June 2025): "Frontend - Movies, Locations, Showtimes"
- Build core design elements like `header`, `navbar`, `footer` to draw page layout
- Build to ensure the following user workflow: choose `City` > choose `Movie` (see `Genre`) > choose `Showtime` (see `Theater` & `Seat`):
    - `Main page`: fetch data from `GET /api/movies/` in movie grid and add link to `MovieDetails page` in every movie card
    - `MovieDetails page`: fetch data from `GET /api/movies/{id}/` to retrieve a single movie, fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/` to list his showtimes and add link to `ShowtimeDetail page`
    - `ShowtimeDetail page`: fetch data from `GET /api/showtimes/{id}/` to retrieve a single showtime, fetch data from `GET /api/locations/theaters/{id}/` & `GET /api/locations/seats/` to retrieve his theater & seats add links to `reserve a ticket` and `buy a ticket`
